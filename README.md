# ReplyGenie

## Objective

> ReplyGenie is an application that allows for emails to have a suggested response based on the user's way of responding. 

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

- User will be able to type a normal email
- As the email is getting typed, a suggested response based off of users previous responses will appear highlighted for user to use in email

## Stretch Goals
**Easy:**
- Basic Keyword Recognition: Implement a system to recognize basic keywords in emails (e.g., "meeting," "urgent," "question").
- Simple Template Responses: Create a few template responses that can be auto-suggested based on recognized keywords.
- User Interface: Develop a basic user interface for selecting and inserting suggested responses.

**Medium:**
- Personalization: Implement personalization features where the system learns from the user's past responses to suggest more tailored replies.
- Sentiment Analysis: Incorporate sentiment analysis to gauge the tone of the email and suggest appropriately toned responses.
- Advanced UI Features: Enhance the user interface to allow for easy editing and customization of suggested responses.

**Hard:**
- Deep Learning Models: Use advanced deep learning models (like transformers) to generate more sophisticated and contextually accurate responses.
- Real-Time Suggestions: Ensure the system provides real-time response suggestions as the user types.
